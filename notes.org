* +This whole thing should probably be wrapped in a bash script:+
** Call julia to generate files, submit files, then put the results back into julia

* Actually julia interacts well with the shell so just do it in julia

read_xyz
store as labels and atoms
calculate reference energy (E_0)

Calculate first derivatives:
\[F_1 \rightarrow \frac{\partial E}{\partial x} = \frac{E(O_x + \delta)-E(0)}{\delta}\]
\[F_2 \rightarrow \frac{\partial E}{\partial x} = \frac{E(O_x - \delta)-E(0)}{\delta}\]
...
for example, with coordinates 
\begin{bmatrix}
Ox1 & Oy1 & Oz1\\
Hx1 & Hy1 & Hz1\\
 - & - & -
\end{bmatrix}

space is arbitrarily 250 files for now, that's the submission limit for the queue I think?
while jobs to run:
    if there is space:
	generate files
	run files
	check if finished by looking at last line of molpro outputs?
	when finished running:
	    calculate energy
	    delete files
    else:
	wait

variations probably are just moving each combination of coordinates by the differential
x1, y1, z1
x2, y2, z2
-> 
x1+d, y1, z1
x2, y2, z2
...
x1+d, y1+d, z1+d
x2, y2, z2
...
x1+d, y1+d, z1+d
x2+d, y2+d, z2+d


$$\begin{bmatrix}
x1 & y1 & z1\\
x2 & y2 & z2\\
x3 & y3 & z3\\
\end{bmatrix} +
 \begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}$$

first derivatives are stepping one coordinate at a time,
second derivatives are two at a time ...
including the same one twice

have python wait for molpro so you just keep changing one input file
instead of writing them all, just capture desired value too and 
overwrite the output file each time too to save space

* Meeting notes

Most abundant element : hydrogen, then helium, 93%, 7%, then everything else is left
Most of H is in stars 
reaction 2/1H + 3/1H -> 4/2He + 1/0n + hnu
reaction 4/2He + 4/2He -> 8/4Be

nuclei are not static, they re fluctuating, moving and bouncing off each other
strong nuclear force pulls them back together, unless they get too far apart

iron is the largest nucleus that cna be held together by the strong force
Be will fall apart because the protons can never get far enough apart to be comfortable
Be breaks down fast
keeps mass density of th esun low enough thta it doesnt collapse on itself
helium migrates out because it has greater momentum

alpha process elements -> something + He so C, O, Ne

xC + yO -> usually y > x -> xCO + (y-x)H2O, lots of hydrogen

if x > y -> yCO + (x-y)CHn

break down pahs to make more pahs
break down water to make oxides like little rocks

+Potential molecule+: Al(OH)2

** Ideas: 
    - N=N-N, azole
    - O=N-N=O
      
** Do these ones:
    - Mg-O-Al
      singlet, triplet
    - MgO2Al square
      CCCA calculations
      geometry optimization of both of these at CCSD(T)-f12/cc-pvtz-f12
